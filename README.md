# Chip8
A very basic and potentially incomplete Chip-8 interpreter written in C 

This is an extremely basic chip-8 interpretter written in C as a side project to aid my learning.
As a result of its informal nature and simple goals, it is not terribly user-friendly, features
may be missing, and running certain files may lead to errors. The code is not terribly clean or
consistent - this is a result of me trying new things as I went along, focusing on learning over
consistency. 

I do not recommend using this Chip-8 interpreter for recreatoinal use of Chip-8 programs. However,
it is licensed under the MIT License, so if you choose you're permitted to use it more or less as 
you please within the restrictions of such. Enjoy!
